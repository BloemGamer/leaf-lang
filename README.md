# S-lang
A language I made that compiles to C.

Compiler stages
- [] preprocessor (this wil be done the last I think)
- [x] lexing -> lex
- [] parsing -> parse
- [] semantic analyzer
- [] optimalisations??
- [] code generator
- [] calling C compiler

Each stage should have
- the main function
- print function
- free function

Future plans
- [] finish the first version of the compiler
- [] add (automated) tests
- [] write proper documentation
- [] some example files, and hopefully a simple project to test and show a lot of features
